- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpalmer85
- 👀 I’m interested in making a website for the first time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and css via a course I signed up for on Coursera, but it is pretty intimedating. I'm really not spam, I just know absolutely nothing at this point except how to download Sublime and make a github account, haha.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you can share with an absolute beginner trying to upskill.
- 📫 You can message me through github...I think.
